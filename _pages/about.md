I'm Senior Software Engineer at Meta, working on improving the safety of Meta AI. Previously, I was a <a href='https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu'>Masterâ€™s</a> student at <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/'>Carnegie Mellon University</a> advised by <a href='http://pfliu.com/'>Prof. Pengfei Liu</a> and <a href='http://www.phontron.com/'>Prof. Graham Neubig</a> where I worked on text summarization. Prior to this, I was a research assistant at <a href='https://iisc.ac.in/'>Indian Institute of Science</a> advised by <a href='https://parthatalukdar.github.io/'>Prof. Partha Talukdar</a>. My research broadly focused on Knowledge Graphs, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) and the ways of improving them.
