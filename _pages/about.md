I'm Senior Software Engineer at Meta, working on improving the safety of Meta AI. Previously, I was an Applied Scientist at Amazon, working on Search and Recommender Systems to improve Alexa's Speach Recognition and Language Understanding. I did my <a href='https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu'>Masterâ€™s</a> at <a href='https://www.cmu.edu/'>Carnegie Mellon University</a> advised by <a href='http://pfliu.com/'>Prof. Pengfei Liu</a> and <a href='http://www.phontron.com/'>Prof. Graham Neubig</a> where I worked on text summarization. Prior to that, I was a research assistant at <a href='https://iisc.ac.in/'>Indian Institute of Science</a> advised by <a href='https://parthatalukdar.github.io/'>Prof. Partha Talukdar</a>. My research broadly focuses on LLMs, Safety Alignment, Search, Recommender Systems, Knowledge Graphs and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs).
